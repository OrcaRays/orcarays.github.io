## Real people  Real work  Real talk

**We believe in seeing clearly and choosing rightly.**

In a world driven by noise, velocity, and posturing, we build systems that understand, not systems that impress.

**Information asymmetry is inevitable**, but not unchallengeable. Through radical curiosity, intelligent systems, and independent thinking, we seek to close the gap between **what is visible** and **what is meaningful**.

We are not here to predict the world. We are here to understand the systems that shape it, and act accordingly.



## About OrcaRays

>Real people  Real work  Real talk

OrcaRays was founded by a group of researchers and practitioners from the University of Toronto, the National University of Singapore, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University—with roots in physics, computational biology, finance, and automata.

We believe the future of finance isn't about predicting markets.
 It's about understanding the world—deeply, structurally, systemically.

While others fine-tune language models to chase price movements, we build systems that read beyond the chart:
 to extract structure, detect signals, and grow in reasoning.

Our work begins with **Project Ray**—a foundation-model-inspired system that thinks with us, not for us.

OrcaRays is not a product. It’s a position.
 We’ve seen too many institutions mistake stories for research.
 We’ve seen interns write the reports that move billions.
 We’re here because someone has to do better.

We don't want to be big.
 We want to be right.
 **Sharp beats loud. Small beats bloated. Truth beats noise.**

OrcaRays is independent, self-funded, and not open to unsolicited collaboration proposals.
